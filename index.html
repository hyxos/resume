      <h3>Summary</h3>
      <hr />
      <p>
        After completing a History degree with highest honours I began my professional path as 
        a communications and sales representative for AT&ampT in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
        Relocating to Canada in 2003, I continued working in communications
        as an Advanced Emergency Medical Dispatcher for the City of Toronto. Then in 2015, inspired by the challenges
        and rewards of software development, I transformed
        my lifelong hobby of tinkering with computers into a career as a Full Stack Developer.
      </p>
      <h3>Goal</h3>
      <hr />
      <p>
        I seek a positive work place that appreciates my broad skill set and diverse experience.
        My favourite programming language is Javascript, but I am definitely open to working with code 
        bases built with Ruby or Python. Ultimately, I want to be part of a great team where I get a chance to learn from those 
        with more experience and share my knowledge with those just starting out. 
      </p>

        <h4 class="role">Cofounder/Full Stack Developer</h4>
        <h5>March 2013 to Current</h5>
      </div>
      <p>
        In 2013 I cofounded Hyxos Inc. with my partner in order to pursue business ideas.
        My current focus is creating and developing a design system and assets for physical 
        and digital games using React, SVGs, and Next.js.

        <h5>Oct. 2019 to Feb. 2020</h5>
      </div>
      <p>
        My greatest accomplishments working for this fantasy sports startup involved optimizing buggy, 
        slow frontend Javascript built in React and significantly reducing API calls to strained 
        backend infrastructure. During day to day operations I engaged every level of the 
        software stack including configuration, bug-fixing, data-normalization, and deployment. 
        As a senior developer I contributed to the organization by scouting, screening, interviewing, selecting, and mentoring junior developers.

      <p>
        I worked with students learning to code primarily in HTML, CSS, 
        and Javascript. They progress through a Full Stack curriculum and I helped them to learn 
        how to use frontend frameworks like React, as well as database design, querying in SQL, version 
        control (through git and Github), and Ruby on Rails. My main responsibilities included 
        helping students getting "unstuck" when running into difficulties while coding, as well 
        as going in depth with them by communicating the concepts, methods, and tools involved in web 
        development.

      <p>
        As my primary accomplisment at this startup focused on providing a never ending exploration of Ontario's craft-beer scene, 
        I organized and automated the process of synchronizing customer data
        with third-party APIs to help drive email marketing campaigns.
        Working with Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL and Javascript I also maintained and extended administrative and other
        backend support features of the company web portal, as well as planned and implemented additional product features.
